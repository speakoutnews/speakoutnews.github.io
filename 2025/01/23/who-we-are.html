<p><em>Speak Out</em> is dedicated to shining a light on all the ways Trump, Republicans, MAGA, conservatives, reactionaries, and white supremacists are harming our siblings and comrades, the vulnerable and the disempowered, and even themselves, as they rush towards a fascist America.  In our thoughtful, well-researched articles, we will expose the harms and deeply flawed motivations behind these terrible ideologies, while also presenting our ideas for a truly just and fair society.</p>
